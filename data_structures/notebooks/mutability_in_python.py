        Mutability in Python is not always straightforward. Therefore, it's important to be wary about using and having mutable objects, especially as inputs to functions to avoid undesired behavior.

        One of the most notorious mutable elements in Python are lists, but there are other not so intuitive ones that may also be problematic.

        I will go over some of these below for reference.

        One of the most surprising to me was tuple mutability. In Python, tuples work as **immutable memory references**. They are generally treated as immutable objects, but this isn't precisely true.

        This **reference immutability** means that any tuple will consist of immutable pointers to objects in memory. But this doesn't mean that one can't change tuples in any way. If we attempt tuple assignation as above, we will get an error as we cannot change the reference of the tuple, as expected.

        But what happens if we create a mutable object and create a tuple that uses that element? Internally, Python will create a list of references in memory to each object we created.

        If we create the tuple as:

        ```python
        tuple1 = ('a', 2, 'c')
        ```

        Python will treat the tuple objects as a set of memory pointers all stored during creation. Every time we try to print the tuple, the string representation of the tuple will then go to each of those memory locations and retrieve the corresponding value.

        Imagine these where stored in memory like this:

        tuple1 = (`<fx012b23>`, `<kd90x0002>`, `<fp55hx9091>`)

        Where for each pointer, when we go to retrieve it's value we will find the value of the object we stored there. So, for example, we can create the following tuple:

        So what is the difference? Is a tuple just a list? Not really, as the tuple references are still immutable, and Python tuples are created and stored as fixed length objects as Python doesn't need to preemptively or dynamically allocate extra memory to account for the possibility of us adding / removing elements.

        ## 2) Mutability in multiplication / concatenation

        Another example that caught me off guard is creating multiple lists with the `"*"` sign. In Python you can concatenate two lists using the sumation sign:

        ```python
        list1 = [1, 2]
        list2 = [3, 4]

        list1 + list2
        ```

        ```python
        >>> [1, 2, 3, 4]
        ```

        You can think of the multiplication sign `"*"` as we think about it as a mathematical operation, that applies the sumation between objects `n` times. So, if we do the following:

        ```python
        [1, 2] * 3
        ```

        It's equivalent to doing:

        ```python
        [1, 2] + [1, 2] + [1, 2]
        ```

        And the output will in both cases be:

        ```python
        [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]
        ```
